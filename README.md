# data-science-consulting
Conceptualizing and developing a consulting project as a virtual consulting company, this project encompasses the provision of consulting services with a strong focus on optimizing ABC Health Insurance's healthcare network, specifically targeting home health agencies. Through a meticulously detailed report, the project aims to offer reproducible results, elucidate the challenges faced, and provide actionable recommendations based on thorough analysis. A dynamic Shiny application will complement the report by offering an interactive platform for users to explore and visualize project findings. Furthermore, the project presents a forward-looking proposal for future work, outlining viable strategies, resource allocation, and timelines to sustain and extend the project's impact. With a commitment to data-driven insights and client-centric solutions, our project seeks to empower ABC Health Insurance to navigate the complex healthcare landscape, manage risks effectively, and enhance customer satisfaction, ultimately tailoring insurance products to the unique needs of policyholders.
